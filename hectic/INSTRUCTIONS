Welcome to Hectic!

You are @@.

You must run around a room using the curser keys and collect items:

	<> is worth 10 Gold
	:: is worth 20 Gold
	$$ is worth 50 Gold

After you start running you can't stop anymore.

You must not run into the walls or into boxes. If you do, your energy
decreases.

If your energy runs out, the game is over.

When you have collected all items, a new, more cluttered room is generated
and you start over with 10 more energy points.

To end prematurely press 'q'.

Alternatively you can use the vi movement keys to run around.
